## 🚀 Project Overview

**Jarvis-CV** is an intelligent, voice-based personal assistant that responds to your spoken queries and commands. Powered by **NLP**, **TTS**, **speech recognition**, and **computer vision**

You can ask it anything—from your current location, weather, or time—to performing tasks like opening a website, searching Wikipedia, or identifying objects using your webcam.

> This is a prototype that showcases how NLP + CV + TTS + Voice recognition can be combined into a **simple yet powerful AI assistant**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries

| Purpose                   | Library Used               | Notes                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web UI                   | `streamlit`                | For quick prototyping and deployment                                 |
| NLP                      | `openai`                   | Used GPT models to respond intelligently to user prompts             |
| Speech to Text           | `speechrecognition`        | Converts spoken commands to text                                     |
| Text to Speech           | `pyttsx3`                  | Offline TTS engine for natural-sounding speech                       |
| CV (Camera + Detection)  | `opencv-python`            | Used for capturing webcam and basic object detection                 |
| Audio Handling           | `pyaudio` / `sounddevice`  | Initially used `pyaudio`, switched to `sounddevice` due to install issues on Windows |
| Environment Management   | `python-dotenv` (optional) | For securely loading API keys if needed                              |

## 🔄 Why I Switched Some Libraries

| Library             | Switched From → To       |                                                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pyaudio` → `sounddevice` + `soundfile` | `pyaudio` is hard to install on some Windows setups; switched for smoother install |
| `gTTS` → `pyttsx3`  | `gTTS` requires internet and has latency; `pyttsx3` works offline and faster |
| `flask` (idea) → `streamlit` | Wanted faster prototyping with built-in UI components |
